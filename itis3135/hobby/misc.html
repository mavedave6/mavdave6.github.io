					<p>Pawn Sacrifice is a historical drama film released in 2015 that tells the story of Bobby Fischer,

						The film follows Fischer's rise to fame and his tumultuous personal life as he prepares to take
						 on the Soviet Union's top chess player, Boris Spassky, in the 1972 World Chess Championship.
The film explores Fischer's obsession with chess and his struggles with mental illness,
including his paranoia and erratic behavior. It also delves into the political tensions between the United States
 and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, as Fischer's match with Spassky becomes a proxy for the two superpowers' ideological and cultural differences.</p>
