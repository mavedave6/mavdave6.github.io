            <p>
              Chess has long been a popular board game, but in recent years, it has seen a significant increase in popularity.
               This is due to a number of factors, the rise of top players like Magnus Carlsen, the growth of chess in education etc. However I think import
               reall rose to peak engagement during the lockdown period. Everybody was getting into it; streamers, musicains, celeberities etc. There was
               even a famous event for newcommers into the chess world called pogchamps. The whole boom lead to rise in popularity of chess films and shows such
               the queens gambit and pawn sacrifice. There was overall a rapid increase in people that play/watch chess.
             </p>

             <h2>Professional Chess Variation</h2>
             <p>
               Professional chess players are tested by their prowess n different time modes and chess varaitions.
               Examples of these time modes are;
               <ul>
                <li>Classical chess: widely considered as the most prestegious chess variation there is. It is usually the longest time controlled game
                and the most credible because the  players have the longest time to think. </li>
                <li>Rpid chess: A chess game that uses a time format of 60- 15 minutes per player.</li>
                <li>Blitz chess: Also known as speed chess is a chess variation that uses a time format of 15-3 minutes per player. This is the most Interesting
                kind of chess to watch becuase it is not as long as classical chess which can be up to 7 hours and it is not as short as bullet chess.</li>
                <li>Bullet Chess: A chess variant in which time control is three minutes or less but is usually 1 minute. It leads to really fast and interesting games
                but I don't like watching it because it's hard to keep up.</li>
               </ul>

               Shorter time-control games are usually the most entertaining type of chess to watch because the moves are fast paced and the games pass by more quickly than
               longer ones e.g. classical games. But the longer ones are the true test of vigor and maneuverability and that is why they are the most credible. There are
               other variants of chess that are fascinating but unoffical e.g. Chess 960, duck chess, etc.
             </p>

             <h2>Who is the best professional chess player?</h2>

             <h3>Magnus Carlsen</h3>
             <p>
               Magnus Carlsen is handsdown the most talented chess player now and arguably of all time in my opinion. The reigning world chess champion has held the
                the most prestegious chess title (classical world champion) five times and turned down the opportunity to defend it simply because he didn't want to.
                He has been a beacon of admiration to his supporters and even adversaries. People who have played against him also speak highly of him.
                Right now, there's noone close to him

             </p>

             <h3>Gary Kasparov</h3>
             <p>
               Also arguably the greatest chess player of all time. He was active between the years 1985-2000 winning the classical world chess championship
               6 times in that period. He is widely considered as the most domiant chess player of all time. He passed that torch to magnus carlsen despite their 13
               year differnece in active profesional chess because is the closest to being as dominant as kasparov was.
             </p>

             <h2>Most entertaining?</h2>
