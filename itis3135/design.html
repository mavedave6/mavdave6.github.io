            <strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of my application is to display book recommendations from a catalog of books I've
            already read. It will also provide functionality; when you click on the books, the description is displayed at the bottom
            of the page.

            <strong>Users:</strong> This application targets book lovers and people like me who would like a review before getting into a
            book.
