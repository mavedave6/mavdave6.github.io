        <p class="shh">
          The most realistic "bad website" I could find on the web
        </p>

        <p>
          Though this website doesn't quite follow the first two principles of crap;
          Contrast and Reptition, it does a good job with the last two;
        Alignment and Proximity. However it is still a bad website becauses regardless
        of its correspondence with the last two principles, it fails to adapt the first
        two. A good website follows <b>all</b> principles of crap.
      </p>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong> The best example is the header. Red and blue
          are both really bright colors, yet they're used on two elements here that aren't
          the same; a text element and the background element. Red text on a blue backgroud
          not only makes it hard to read but also gives the website in general an unprofessional look.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Repitition:</strong> At first glance, this website makes really good
          use of repititon but after scrolling to the very end, what I'm assuming is the
          footer is all over the place and doesn't have anything in common with the pages
          above it. The footer doesn't compliment the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> This website makes very good use of alignment.
          All the little paragraphs in every box are formatted similarly, the boxes themselves
          are formatted similarly, they look tidy, organized and each box has a visual connection another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements on this website that are related are grouped together. In every box,
          you see a heading at the top and below the heading, there's a picture and a paragraph complimenting that
          heading.
        </p>


      </div>

      <div class="Website2">

        <h3 class="h3"><a href="https://www.premierleague.com/" target="_blank">Premier League Website</a></h3>

        <p>
        This website makes outstanding use of the crap principles.
      </p>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Contrast:</strong> This website makes use of a lot of diffent colors
          and it does a good job of belnding them well. Most of the time, the text colors
          were either black or white; black when it was a light background and white when
          it was a dark background.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Repitition:</strong> Really good use of repitition. From the header to
          the footer, the same colors are cycled throughout the page. So no matter how far down
          you scroll, you still feel like you're on the premier league website. The font style is consitent
          for every section of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> This website makes very good use of alignment.
          you can see from the website that all the articles and video links are represneted
          by little boxes with captions behind them. All those boxes align perfectly together throughout
          the webpage. In addition to aligning together, they're also formated almost identically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Proximity:</strong> Also makes good use of the principle of proximity. You can tell when a video or article
          is being linked and the webstie overall is really easy to navigate. The captions are close enough to each
          picture so you can tell which caption belongs where.
