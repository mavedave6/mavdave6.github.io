    <ul>
        <li>Beautifully designed. I like the side bar touch; it's differnt and it stands out from all lot of the other websites.</li>
        <li>Color schemes, fonts, spacing are consistent amongst webpages and sections within webapages.</li>
        <li>Contrast is perfect; light color on a dark backgroud is always the right touch.</li>
        <li>Validation works great with no errors, and you added the script to test the current page.</li>
        <li>The font is eye-catching and easy to read which is always a good trait in a website. </li>
        <li>The heading is really well done, with each field starting with a capital letter.</li>
        <li>Included a single h1 element for each page and all titles correspond the the right page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Summary: </strong>Honestly one of the best websites i've seen in the class, i'd say its better than mine,
        great job!

        <li>Color scheme in this website is outstanding; really making html color codes work for you huh.</li>
        <li>TI like the little images used to represent footer links. A little nice gesture that goes a long way.</li>
        <li>Realaly like how the assignments have their own page instead of being cluttered up in the header like mine.</li>
        <li>Contrast is great, pretty fonts and a nice favorite quote</li>
        <li>Validation works great with no errors, and you added the script to test the current page.</li>
        <li>Included h1 that is the same for every page, and added h2 elements with the name of the page</li>
        <li>The consistency is a joy to behold</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Summary: </strong>Very beautiful website from the color, to the fonts, to the structure of the pages.
